# SAS-Space

## Story

The [SAS](https://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Airlines) announces a tender for a web designer
who can redesign their new program, the SAS Space's website page.
This is a new project where they want to announce flights to the space from Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
The tender is about to design an index page with `Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)`.
The best design wins the opportunity to work with the SAS.

## What are you going to learn?

- Sass
- Sass variables
- Sass functions
- Sass nesting

## Tasks

1. Make a navigation bar where a logo and a side bar menu button is presented. The logo is a link and the menu button is clickable but not a link. The navigation bar sytle is up to you.
    - There is a logo in the top left corner of the window
    - There is a burger icon in the top right corner of the window
    - The logo links to the index page
    - The cursor change to pointer above the burger icon  and if the icon is clicked we don't get to another page

2. The content section contains a welcome message. Style it to be looking good.
    - The program's name is highlighted from the other content
    - The word `Space` is also highlighted from the program's name
    - All the content is placed on the center of the page
    - There is a background of the page

3. Make a footer for the page. The footer contains the copyright and 2 icons for email and phone.
    - The copyright section is presented on the bottom of the page
    - The icons is placed on the bottom of the page and they change color when hovered

4. [OPTIONAL] Make the burger icon change to an `X` when you hover over the burger icon and make it back to a burger icon when you leave the burger icon's space with the cursor.
    - When we hover over the burger icon, it changes to an `X`
    - When we leave the burger icon's place, it changes back from the `X` to the burger icon

## General requirements

- All the CSS is generated from an SCSS file

## Hints

- Try to separate the functions and variables from the styling. Use different files for that.
- If you use a `_` before the SCSS or SAS file name, that file won't compiled to CSS.
- Don't use **too** much nesting. The nesting helps in the readability but the too much nesting turn it upside-down.
- For the contact icons you can use Fontawesome icons but you can always create your own SVG-s for that.
